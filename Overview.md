* **Texture**: A subtle fractal noise grain overlay to simulate paper fibers.
* **Ink Bleed**: Soft radial gradients of brand colors blurred in the background.

* Fully rounded capsule shape with a large border radius and circular corners.
* Soft shadow plus a subtle border to emphasize the floating effect.

3. > **Scaleup CEOs. 3 hours. 0 Fluff.**
On desktop keep this quote on a single line.
For decades, the Israeli dream was the quick Exit. But something changed. A new generation of founders decided to go long. To build category defining companies that last. We sit down with them for 3 hours. Unfiltered. No PR fluff. Just the raw, unscripted playbook of how to scale from Tel Aviv.

4. **Us.**: 
    **Erez Shachar** | *The Dean of Israeli ScaleUp*
From CEO of a NASDAQ company to investing in them. Erez built Israel's first growth VC Fund, Qumra Capital, with one big dream: *What if Israel stopped being exit nation and actually became a scaleup nation?* Erez has seen *everything*. Two decades of boardrooms. Dozens of CEOs. Billions in value created. From early stage chaos to IPO bells on NASDAQ. He's here to make the discussion authentic. The kind of stuff that happens after the board meeting ends.
**Ram Ben Ishay** | *The Young Challenger*
28. Restless. From Spokesperson at the Israeli Consulate in NYC to VC in Silicon Valley. Crossed to the builder side, leading product teams in LA and Tel Aviv. Teaches at Reichman University. All of it chasing the same question: *How do you build something that actually lasts?*

*David vs. Goliath. But with LLMs.*
